# MONKEY INTERPRETER IN GO


## Introduction


I am using this project to learn Go. I have been using Java for a while now and I wanted to learn a new language. I chose Go  as it is used in many projects that I am interested in. I am also interested in learning how interpreters work and how to write one. This project is a good way to learn both Go and how interpreters work.

This is a Monkey interpreter written in Go. It is based on the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.
